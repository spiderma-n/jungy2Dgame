# jungy2Dgame
this is my first 2D game, that I learned every thing from Youtube, and learning how to use Godot and fix code errors with help from Deepseek
# about this game
- parkour
- pixel art
- 2D game
# How long did it take on this project
I spent half of my entire school break to learning basic of GDscript and Godot system
# Inspiration
At first, I was trying to figure out which faculty I really wanted to study in. I knew I was interested in computers, and I also knew that what I loved doing the most was playing games. I had always thought that when I grew up, I wanted to work as a game developer. Then one idea popped into my head "if that’s what I want, why not try making a game myself?"

I had no idea how it would turn out because I barely had any coding experience. But with the motivation I had and the joy of trying, I gave it a shot. It was really difficult. I made a lot of mistakes in my code and had to rewrite things countless times. But when the errors were finally fixed and the code worked, it made me so happy.

All of this effort resulted in this game. It’s not flashy or perfect, but I see it as my first step, one that came from effort and the courage to overcome my fears. I’m very proud of myself and I’m excited to try making other types of games next.
